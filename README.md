# Securely Embed Payments in a Python App

This is a Python application that demonstrates an embedded payment solution with [North's Custom Pay API](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/full-featured/custom-pay-api). The full-stack code in this repository adds a simple payment form to a website, handling both the front-end and back-end aspects of the payment process.

## Get Sandbox Credentials

To get started, create a free [North Developer Portal account](https://developer.paymentshub.com/auth/signup). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. After you log in, check out the official [Custom Pay API Integration Guide](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/full-featured/custom-pay-api/integration), then [contact](https://developer.paymentshub.com/contact) North's Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
